Introduction
---
In my quest to improve my landing page design prowess, I chose to make a clone of a simple landing page from leadpages.com.

The original can be [found here](https://www.leadpages.com/templates/preview/9qXXtSSH7WDpG9q7Y3gSNM).

Methodology
---

After noting some of the basic styles for the page in my Browser's Dev Tools, I scaffolded the layout in HTML and added the Styles in CSS. Worked on JavaScript last.


<br>

Tools I Used
---

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
- Mobile-Friendly development

<br>

What I learned
---

The trickest part for me was with the animated portions (the loading wheel upon submission, and the checkmark). I saw in the Dev Tools that those icons were nested elements inside the button, but I found it was easier put them in a parent div container, use CSS to position it, then manipulate its visibility using JavaScript (using EventListeners to listen for the end of animation and transition before taking the next action).

<br>

Items for further study
---

Animation, animation, ANIMATION! Whilst I did a quick course on animation on [Scrimba's Learning Platform](https://scrimba.com/learn/cssanimations), there's still a heck of a lot to learn!


I also started learning Sass, and once I get a better feel for it, I will definitely revisit this project and get things tidier.

- [Create a Custom SVG Checkbox (Animated AND Accessible!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iQVS7WddE): Gary Simon is one of my fave instructors in the realm of UX/UI design, and this tutorial help me get a better idea on how to go about animate the checkmark.

- [Pure CSS Loaders](https://loading.io/css/): site where I found the loading spinner used.
